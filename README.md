this is still a work in progress

This project is web app which allows users to easily control their Spotify playback using Spotify's API in a window designed to be resized and displayed on the side of the screen.

Features include:
-viewing current playback
-controling playback (pause/resume, play next/previous)
-playing a user's playlists
-seaching Spotify within the app
-setting a custom color theme for the app
-re-aligning elements within the app

Unfortunatly Spotify's API only allows for playback features to be used by premium accounts, so while the app will still load for non-premium accounts, it won't be useful for much more than displaying playback.
